Hey! Another post, look at that. This is the last post I will be
starting for the day, but it might be my most interesting one.

Much like how I just finished my introduction to data science course
(see my previous post regarding my data analytics report), I also just
finished a very interesting course in the philosophy of data. It was
definitely the most interesting class I have ever taken, and I learned a
lot about the philosophy of science, making an argument, and the
philosophy of data. Now, this topic is essentially data ethics, however,
the class focused heavily on the history of science and how to generate
an argument, objection, and replies to objections using passages we
read. For our final assignment, we were tasked with taking a passage
from Kate Crawford\'s popular article, \"The Hidden Biases in Big
Data,\" and responding to it.

I would love to write a whole post really diving into this topic, but I
already did it in my paper, so I will let it speak for itself.

To check it out, here is the link: [Data Analytics Papers](https://github.com/Baseballfan5303/DataAnalyticsPapers). I have included Kate
Crawford\'s article on there too!

Enjoy!
