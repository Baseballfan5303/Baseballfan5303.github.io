Hi readers! Long time no see (again I guess)!

Today I want to share an MLB project I have been working on for a few
weeks now. For those of you familiar with the MLB, you might know that
MLB.com has their very own \"Top 100 Prospects List\" listing the best
up and coming baseball players in the league. Here is a link to their
list:Â [[https://www.mlb.com/prospects/top100/]{.underline}](https://www.mlb.com/prospects/top100/).
Over the past year or so, I have become a big fan of paying attention to
prospects and trying to see who the next big stars are. However, I
wanted to come up with my own Top 100 list using Minor League Baseball
player data provided by Fangraphs ([[Fangraphs\' MILB \"Big
Board\"]{.underline}](https://www.fangraphs.com/prospects/the-board-scouting-and-stats?sort=5,-1))
and my programming experience in R. This post will describe my process.
Enjoy!
