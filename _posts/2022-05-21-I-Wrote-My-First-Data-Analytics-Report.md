Hi everyone! It\'s a busy day for Connecting the Game as I have been
working on a lot of different projects over the past few months and
really want to share them.

I recently finished my first class in data analytics, an introduction to
data science course going over the R programming language and several
statistics concepts related to data analysis. For our final project, we
had to write a report on a dataset that we were interested in and use
the modeling and analytical techniques we learned to process, visualize,
and interpret our data. I chose to analyze the 30 MLB franchises from
1998-2021 and try to find similarities and groups between the franchises
while also using their performance to possibly predict how well an
expansion team might perform in today\'s MLB.

I would write a whole big explanation about my report, but I think I
should let it speak for itself. To check it out, use this link: \[\].

I really thought that the outline I used help organize the paper and
make a solid foundation for how to approach a data analytics problem.
This was helpful especially because we had to use both unsupervised and
supervised learning (I go into more detail about them in my report) and
discuss modeling and results.

I hope you enjoy!
