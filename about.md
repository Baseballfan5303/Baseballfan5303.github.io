Hello! My name is Andrew Scheiner and thank you for taking the time to check out my new website hosted by GitHub pages.
I live in Allentown, Pennsylvania and I am currently a sophomore at Dickinson College (Carlisle, PA) double majoring in both Computer Science and Data Analytics. 
My experience includes data analysis and visualization, app and web development, research, and coding through college courses and jobs.
I am currently looking for a internship close to my hometown for Summer '23 which includes working with computer science, data analytics,
software/app/web development and/or database management and visualization.

Please feel free to check out my socials included on the bottom of the page and please email me with any questions you might have!

**Thank you** to the maintainers and contributors at [the Jekyll Minima GitHub repo](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). I relied heavily on their coding concepts to build my site from the ground-up.
