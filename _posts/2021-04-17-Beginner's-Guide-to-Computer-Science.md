Welcome back everyone,

This post will be outlining how to begin learning about computer science
and what you can do with it. While this post says beginners, people of
all levels of computer science knowledge are encouraged to keep reading
this article to get an idea of resources and strategies that are
available for free online.

So, this guide will outline the following topics (*italicized* = done):

-   *What is computer science?*
-   *How big computer science is and application vs. theory*
-   *Where to get started if interested in computer science*
-   How to find online material for guidance
-   Where to find help when stuck
-   How to prepare to be a computer science major in school

**What is computer science?**

Well, great question. Merriam-Webster defines computer science as \"a
branch of science that deals with the theory of computation or the
design of computers.\" And Wikipedia gives a much more detailed
definition: \"the study of algorithmic
processes, computational
machines and
computation itself pans a range of topics from theoretical studies
of algorithms, computation and information to
the practical issues of implementing computational systems
in hardware and software."
As someone who has been developing and programming for fun over the past
few years, I feel like the simplest definition I can give is that
computer science is the study of how computers function and the endless
possibilities that come along with them. By saying \"endless
possibilities\" I am hinting at the potential computers have and how
many different aspects of computers are used in many different
specialized fields.

**How big is computer science? (& application vs. theory)**

Computer science covers a very large span of specialized fields in which
you can start learning about today. You have two different general areas
in which all of the specialized fields generally fall under: applied and
theoretical computer science. Theory for computer science differs from
theory in other studies because of how important to learn new methods
and strategies to be implemented in development of projects. Topics
include: Algorithms, Data Structure, Computation, and more. When we talk
about applications of computer science, however, topics of study and
fields are much more specialized than the theory necessary for
application. Topics of application include: App/Web Development,
Cybersecurity, Networking, Programming, Data Science, Machine Learning,
and lots more. From my experience, this is how wide I have reached with
computer science after learning in school and working on projects/jobs,
but let me show you what Britannica has to say about how big computer
science has grown.

Britannica talks about computer science having traditional studies like
Computer Architecture, Programming Languages, and Software Development.
But what I like that they mention is how computer science intervenes in
other fields of study such as biology to form Bioinformatics and
chemistry for Computational Chemistry. So we can use computer science
knowledge and fundamentals to help learn and innovate other major fields
of studies like physical and biological science. Here are the 15
distinct fields Britannica mentions make up computer science:

-   Algorithms and complexity
-   Architecture and organization
-   Computational science
-   Graphics and visual computing
-   Human-computer interaction
-   Information management
-   Intelligent systems
-   Networking and communication
-   Operating systems
-   Parallel and distributed computing
-   Platform-based development
-   Programming languages
-   Security and information assurance
-   Software engineering
-   Social and professional issues

**Where to get started**

Let\'s say you are like me, someone who has some background in computer
science from school, but not much knowledge on where to get started
learning what you want on your own. This is what I recommend you do:

1.  Decide which field(s) of computer science interest you.
2.  Don\'t just Google Search \"how to get started with\" because it
    will give you too many results. Head to Microsoft Learn before you
    resort to using your search
    engine: [https://docs.microsoft.com/learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn).
3.  Once on Microsoft Learn, create a Microsoft account if you don\'t
    have one or sign in if you do have one. (Not entirely necessary, but
    good if you want to save what you do in the next few steps)
4.  Click on \"Customize my path\" so that the \"What roles are you
    interested screen\" shows up with a bunch of different options to
    click.
5.  Go through this quick survey so that Microsoft will be able to give
    you the best learning modules to start working on. I recommend
    choosing Visual Studio as your product if you are unsure.
6.  Click on \"Browse recommendations\" to see which learning modules
    you were recommended to start with.
7.  When browsing your results, pay close attention to the color, time,
    and tags of each module. And, of course, be sure to read the
    description/title. Color signifies product and knowing what software
    and time will be needed for the module is important in this process,
    so be aware as you go through your results.
8.  Pick any module for now to look at.

Upon clicking on the module, you will see more tags and descriptions of
what you will be learning, as well as learning objectives. But the most
important part is the Prerequisites you need to follow along. For a
Xamarin module, I need to have Visual Studio 2019 installed and be
familiar with C\# and .NET. So, before you get started with any of these
modules make sure you know what you will be learning, how long it will
take you, and what software/prereqs you need to continue. All of this
will help you get a great head start on your journey to learning
something new in computer science.

\[To be continued\]
